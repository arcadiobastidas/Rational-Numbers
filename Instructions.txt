10.8 (Rational Numbers) Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions.
Write an app to test your class. Use integer variables to represent the private instance variables
of the class—the numerator and the denominator. Provide a constructor that enables an object of 
this class to be initialized when it’s declared. The constructor should store the fraction in reduced
form. The fraction 2/4 is equivalent to 1/2 and would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator.

Provide a parameterless constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide public methods that perform each of the following operations (all calculation results should be stored in a reduced form):
                  a) Add two Rational numbers. 
                  b) Subtract two Rational numbers.
                  c) Multiply two Rational  numbers.
                  d) Divide two Rational  numbers.
                  e) Display Rational  numbers in the form a/b, where a is the  numerator and b is the denominator.
                  f) Display Rational  numbers in floating-point format. (Consider providing formatting capabilities that enable the user of the class to specify the
                      number of digits of precision to the right of the decimal point.)
Your program should implement exception handling if needed.
